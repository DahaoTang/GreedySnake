# GreedySnake by pygame



## Intro

This is the *GreedySnake* game written by `pygame`.

I have generated excitable files for Microsoft Windows (.exe), macOS (.app) and Linux (.sh) using `pyinstaller`.

You can go to the `dist` folder to run the game.



## Game Instruction

It may take a few seconds to open the game file. Upon entering the game successfully, you should see “Welcome to GreedySnake”. Now press the `[space]` key to start the game.

Your goal is to “eat” the food. During the game, you can use the arrow keys or `[W]`, `[A]`, `[S]`, `[D]` to control the direction of the snake. 

If you hit the wall (window edge) or your body, the game is over. To restart the game, press the `[space]` key.

During the game, you can press the `[space]` key to pause the snake, then any of the arrow keys or `[W]`, `[A]`, `[S]`, `[D]` to continue in the direction newly given. You can pree `[R]` to restart the game during the game.

You can press `[K]` to exit the game at any point . **(Click the close button on the window won’t work.)**
